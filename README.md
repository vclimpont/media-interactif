## A sad day 

A Sad Day is a short interactive experience made with Unity.

It consists in indefinitely repeating the same day of an embittered employee by chaining daily events through different options of replies.
It is above all a small programming desire in which I was curious about how to develop mechanics that are similar to those of Reigns mobile game, such as a random draw of cards based on choices.

Narratively, the experience also depicts the gloom that may be generated by routine.
